# Determinant

Based on [3Blue1Brown video](https://youtu.be/Ip3X9LOh2dk) and [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)

Geometrically, it can be viewed as the volume scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix.

This is also the signed volume of the n-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix.

In linear algebra, the determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.

The determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of n-space.
